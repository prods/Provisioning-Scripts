## Ubuntu Provisioning Scripts for the Masses

This project contains multiple Ubuntu specific provisioning shell scripts.
I created these scripts to automate the processes of provisioning my Ubuntu development VMs on my Vagrant and ESXi environments.

All scripts were successfully tested on Ubuntu 15.04 Server.

*These scripts are provided "as-is". Be mindful of reviewing what they do before using them.*
