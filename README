## Ubuntu Provisioning Scripts for the Masses

This project contains multiple Ubuntu specific provisioning shell scripts.
I originally created these scripts in order to automate the provisioning of my Ubuntu development VMs on my Vagrant and  ESXi environments. But after a while using them I decided to publish the repo in order to make it available for everyone.

All scripts were successfully tested on Ubuntu 15.04 Server.

*These scripts are provided "as-is". Be mindful of reviewing what they do before using them.*
